**Installing mods is optional.** You should be able to join the server without issue even without them. However, to ensure compatibility and any issues when connecting to the server, I recommend following these steps for installing mods. These steps will streamline the process of installing them.

1. [Download & Open "Fabric Launcher"](https://maven.fabricmc.net/net/fabricmc/fabric-installer/1.0.1/fabric-installer-1.0.1.exe)
    - Minecraft Version: *v1.20.4*
    - Loader Version: *0.15.9*
    - Check *"Create Profile"*, install, and exit when finished.

2. [Download "AutoModPack"](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/k68glP2e/versions/1ZPaL1PB/automodpack-fabric-4.0.0-beta1-1.20.4.jar)
    - Open Run Dialog with ```Windows Key + R```, paste ```%appdata%/.minecraft/mods``` into it, and press ```OK```
    - Move *AutoModPack* mod into the folder
3. Select the newly added `fabric-loader-1.20.4` profile and run Minecraft with it.

4. Connect to the server. When you join, you'll be prompted with a message asking you to download mods and to restart your game, select `Download` and rejoin the server.

5. You're done! You should be able to join the server.
